1. create unit tests for all new (wut_devel branch) classes

2. create functional tests using a platform (public IP?) and script them using BOOST testing framework

3. create elaborate examples, contained within their folders

4. fix CMakeLists.txt to create an `examples` directory and a `tests` directory copying executables, tests and test files
